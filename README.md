# GuerillaPython
GuerillaPython is a compilation of projects that might have been written for fun or for school. 
The purpose of putting into one repository is to:
* Create an easy space to store small projects and ideas
* Educational documentation on creating these projects
* An archive of ideas that don't require anymore attention and majoring changes
